# Adult Income Analysis

This project explores the Adult Income dataset to understand the factors that influence whether an individual's income exceeds $50,000 per year. The dataset includes over 32,000 records and provides details such as age, workclass, education, occupation, and income level. The goal of this analysis is to uncover patterns and trends between demographic factors and income brackets. 

The analysis begins by cleaning the dataset, addressing missing values, and selecting key features such as age, education, and occupation for further examination. Visualizations, including histograms and scatter plots, were created to highlight relationships within the data. For example, the average age of individuals holding a doctorate degree was found to be 47.7 years, while higher education levels tended to correlate with higher income. In addition to exploratory analysis, the project includes steps to group the data by educational attainment and calculate summary statistics.

This project leverages Python, utilizing Pandas for data manipulation and Matplotlib for visualizations. Through this analysis, it was revealed that there is a clear distinction in income levels based on education and occupation. In the future, the project could be expanded by building a machine learning model to predict income categories based on demographic factors. The analysis can be replicated by running the provided Jupyter notebook file, `adult_income_analysis.ipynb`.
